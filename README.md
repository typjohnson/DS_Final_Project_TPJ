# DS_Final_Project_TPJ
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and in our country. This project will dive into the group of diseases and seek out to understand the main factors that contribute to them. Using a relatively large dataset of patients, several predictive analytic models will be created in an attempt to assess whether or not an individual will have a cardiovascular disease. Each of these models will utilize a different separate predictive analysis technique in order to differentiate between which model will perform best for the type of information dealt with in the project. In addition to model building, an exploratory data analysis will be undertaken that aims to answer several key questions related to the factors that cause cardiovascular disease. The project will utilize the Python programming language and several of the libraries included in the language, in addition to the data visualization program, Tableau. Can cardiovascular disease be accurately predicted with demographic, lifestyle, and biometrical information? The models created in this project seek to answer this question.
